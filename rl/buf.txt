1. git ls-files | xargs | du -ch
    how much for git
    what files consume the most repo space

2. I run 
    git branch | wc -l
    which returns 176, so there are 176 local branches. 
    To find remote branches, I run
    git branch -r | wc -l
    which tells me that there are 177 remote branches. 

3. I run
    git remote -v
    which returns:
    origin  https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git (fetch)
    origin  https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git (push)
    So we have a remote repo at git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git, which is the reference
    to where we push commits to. 

4. To find the most recent branches, I run
    git for-each-ref --count=10 --sort=-committerdate refs/heads

    which returned: 
    19aecd340b7b3ab54629b790ba70a90130bad63d commit refs/heads/master
    d2873706749ef68803e79bab6109a534f4c9d23a commit refs/heads/scratch/joaot/make-completion-at-point-function

    55dcd32ad2209dc34bfb6b713bf73be9bf4c4cb2 commit refs/heads/emacs-26

    from most recent, to oldest one. 
    I used refs/heads as that contains the pointers to local branches (heads)
    and for-each-ref, which I found on git's manual, which shows info for each reference in heads. 
    I then sorted it reversed (most recent first) using the --sort=-committerdate option. 

5.  To count the number of commits in master, I used:
    git rev-list master | wc -l
    where the last string corresponds to the branch we want to count the commits for. 
    I get 139583 commits. 

6.  By using man git rev-list, I find that I can list all commits by running:
    git rev-list --all | wc -l
    Which gives me 143910.
    Therefore the percentage is 139583 / 143910 = 0.9699 ~ 0.97%
7.  After discovering that the command git shortlog gives a number of the commits of each author,
    
8.
9.
